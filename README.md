# ReCarnation: The Ultimate Platform for Buying and Selling Pre-Owned Cars

The increasing need for cost-effective and eco-friendly transportation has led to notable expansion in the used car market. Our project tackles this demand by creating a user-friendly, secure web application that streamlines the process of buying and selling pre-owned vehicles.The application is built around a simple, user-friendly interface. Users can securely sign with regular login or with Oauth providing easy access and safe authentication. 

After logging in, the homepage offers quick access to the main features: "Buy," and "Sell” cars. On the "Buy" page, buyers can browse available cars using an advanced search and filtering system, with options to view results in either a grid or list format according to their preference.Each car listing leads to a detailed page where users can review specifications, condition, and pricing, helping them make well-informed decisions. 

Sellers have access to an easy-to-use yet detailed "Sell" page, where they can fill out a form to submit information about their car, including make, model, year, mileage, and price. Once submitted, listings appear in both general search results and the seller’s personal profile. Another key feature of the platform is its administrative system, which gives admins full control over user management and car listings. 

Our platform includes a powerful price predictor feature designed to assist sellers in determining the optimal selling price for their pre-owned cars. By analyzing market trends, car specifications, and other key factors, it provides an accurate estimate, ensuring sellers get the best value while staying competitive.

Administrators can review, approve, or reject listings before they are published, ensuring the market place remains high-quality and trustworthy. They can also manage sold and unsold vehicles, update or remove listing details, and control user permissions as necessary.

The platform’s back-end is integrated with a robust database to securely store user data, car listings, and transaction history. For continuous delivery and automated testing, Jenkins will be employed, streamlining the development process and ensuring the system remains reliable and up to date.

This application aspires to revolutionize the pre-owned car market by offering a transparent, efficient, and trustworthy platform. It simplifies the user journey for both buyers and sellers, while administrative controls ensure a high standard of security and legitimacy in all transactions. With an emphasis on usability and control, this platform will become a valuable tool for those looking to buy or sell used cars.
